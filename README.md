# Non-Intrusive Deep Learning based Perceptual Audio Quality Assessment for User-Generated Content

The repository provides the dataset and the code for the quality assessment of user generated multimedia audio.
The IIT-JMU-UGM Audio Dataset is a repository consisting of audio clips extracted from various sources and degraded by real-world distortions.
The quality assessment algorithm first extracts the vital features from the sound track and then employs a stacked GRU architecture for training the model.

## Dependencies Needed:

    Python
    Tensorflow
    Keras
    Librosa
    Numpy
    Sklearn
    Pandas
    Os
    sys
    
  ## To obtain the objective score on the the test clip, run the predict.py file.
