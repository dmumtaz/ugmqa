# Non-Intrusive Perceptual Audio Quality Assessment for User-Generated Content Using Deep Learning
The repository provides the code for predicting the quality of user generated multimedia audio.
The IIT-JMU-UGM Audio Dataset is a repository consisting of audio clips extracted from various sources and degraded by real-world distortions.
The quality assessment algorithm first extracts the vital features from the sound track and then employs a stacked GRU architecture for training the model.

## Dependencies Needed:

    Python
    glob
    Keras
    Librosa
    Numpy
    Sklearn
    Pandas
    Os
    sys
    
  ## To obtain the objective score on the the test clip using the pre-trained model:
    Download the model_final.json and model_final.h5 files
    Run the predict_github.py file.
